# Language Processing Compiler Construction

This repo contains all the codes and implementations that I've written for my LPCC Course. Programs are coded in Python, and some of them are coded in LEX and YACC. 

This repo contains:-

- Two Pass Assembler
- Two Pass Macro Processor
- Lexical Analyser using LEX
- Compiler using LEX and YACC
- Three Address Code Generation
- Expression to TAC to Assembly

Along with a pdf file for each implementation that explains the theory and algorithm behind the code.
